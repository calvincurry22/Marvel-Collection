# Marvel-Collection

This is a project that I have created to practice fetching data from external APIs. This application allows the user to select a character, then fetches the character data (name, image, description) from an API and displays it in the "preview" component. It will also simultaneously fetch comic book images related to the character from a separate API, and display those images in the preview component.
